                paragraph="Climate change seems like a massive topic; it's hard for people to see what an individual can do to help. Additionally, many people simply expect their government to take steps towards fixing climate change and do not take action themselves. Ultimately, however, the ability to stop climate change lies only in our handsâ€”we have to capitalize on that."

For example, people who bike to work don't need to drive less. And not everyone can afford to buy solar panels. It's too difficult to find advice that works for you."
